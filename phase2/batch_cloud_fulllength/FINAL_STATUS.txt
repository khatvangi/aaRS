BATCH_CLOUD_FULLLENGTH - FINAL STATUS

Date: 2025-12-11
Status: ✓ VERIFIED - DUPLICATES REMOVED

============================================================
ACTIONS TAKEN:
============================================================

✗ DELETED: anc_thrrs_full_*.json (20 files)
   Reason: Identical to ProRS (pre-duplication sequence)

✓ KEPT: anc_prors_full_*.json (20 files)
   Sequence: 2037 aa pre-duplication LUCA ancestor

============================================================
CURRENT CONTENTS:
============================================================

20 JSON files representing pre-duplication LUCA:
  - anc_prors_full_ALA.json through anc_prors_full_VAL.json
  - Each: 2037 aa × 20 amino acids
  - Represents ancestral enzyme BEFORE ProRS/ThrRS split

Reference: /storage/kiran-stuff/aaRS/phase2/inputs/af3_jsons/
           deep_ancestral_pro.json (2037 aa)

============================================================
WHY ONLY ONE SET?
============================================================

At LUCA, ProRS and ThrRS had NOT YET DIVERGED.
There was only ONE ancestral enzyme that handled both
Pro and Thr aminoacylation.

Gene duplication happened later, creating specialized:
  - ProRS (catalytic 500 aa)
  - ThrRS (catalytic 278 aa)

Those specialized sequences are in batch_local_domains.
