⚠️  REDUNDANCY WARNING - DUPLICATE FILES DETECTED
============================================================

ISSUE: ProRS and ThrRS full-length files use IDENTICAL sequences

The ancient reconstruction represents pre-duplication LUCA, so:
  - anc_prors_full_*.json (20 files) = 2037 aa sequence
  - anc_thrrs_full_*.json (20 files) = 2037 aa sequence (SAME!)

This means 20 predictions are DUPLICATES.

============================================================
RECOMMENDATION: Delete One Set
============================================================

Option 1: Keep ProRS, delete ThrRS
  rm anc_thrrs_full_*.json

Option 2: Keep ThrRS, delete ProRS
  rm anc_prors_full_*.json

Either way, you only need 20 predictions (not 40) for this directory.

============================================================
WHY ARE DOMAINS DIFFERENT?
============================================================

The DOMAIN files in batch_local_domains ARE different:
  - ProRS catalytic: 500 aa (unique sequence)
  - ThrRS catalytic: 278 aa (DIFFERENT sequence)

This is because the domain-specific reconstructions represent
post-duplication specialized enzymes, while full-length represents
the pre-duplication ancestral state.

============================================================
CORRECTED TOTAL PREDICTIONS
============================================================

Unique predictions needed:
  ✓ Ancient domains:      60 (all different)
  ✓ Ancient full-length:  20 (not 40 - remove duplicates)
  ✓ Modern full-length:   40 (ProRS ≠ ThrRS)

TOTAL: 120 unique AF3 predictions (not 140)
