============================================================
WHY ProRS/ThrRS FULL-LENGTH WERE IDENTICAL
============================================================

The ancestral reconstruction represents LUCA BEFORE the ProRS/ThrRS
gene duplication event. At this point, there was only ONE enzyme
serving both Pro and Thr aminoacylation.

After duplication:
  - One copy specialized → ProRS (500 aa catalytic domain)
  - Other copy specialized → ThrRS (278 aa catalytic domain)

Timeline:
  LUCA (pre-dup) → ONE enzyme (2037 aa)
                ↓ Gene duplication
  Post-dup LUCA → ProRS (500 aa cat) + ThrRS (278 aa cat)
                ↓ 3.5 billion years
  Modern        → ProRS (572 aa) + ThrRS (663 aa)

============================================================
VERIFIED PREDICTIONS BY EVOLUTIONARY STAGE
============================================================

Ancient LUCA (domains, post-duplication specialization):
  - ProRS catalytic: 20 AAs × 500 aa
  - ProRS editing:   20 AAs × 370 aa
  - ThrRS catalytic: 20 AAs × 278 aa
  = 60 predictions

Ancient LUCA (full-length, pre-duplication ancestor):
  - Ancestral enzyme: 20 AAs × 2037 aa
  = 20 predictions

Modern E. coli (full-length, diverged):
  - ProRS: 20 AAs × 572 aa
  - ThrRS: 20 AAs × 663 aa
  = 40 predictions

TOTAL: 120 unique AF3 predictions

============================================================
KEY FINDINGS FROM ORIGINAL CALCULATIONS
============================================================

Ancient domains (different enzymes):
  - ProRS: Pro 0.78 / Thr 0.70 (11% preference)
  - ThrRS: Thr 0.89 / Pro 0.88 (1% preference - promiscuous)

Modern E. coli (diverged):
  - ProRS: Pro 0.95 / Thr 0.87 (9% preference - maintained)
  - ThrRS: Thr 0.84 / Pro 0.57 (47% preference - evolved!)

These results came from DOMAIN predictions, not full-length.
