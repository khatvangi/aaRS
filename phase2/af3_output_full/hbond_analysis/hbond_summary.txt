HYDROGEN BOND ANALYSIS SUMMARY - For Manuscript
============================================================

Threonine forms -8.0 more H-bonds than Proline on average
The β-hydroxyl group contributes 0.0 H-bonds on average

This supports the hypothesis that threonine's hydroxyl
forms compensating interactions with catalytically essential
polar residues, explaining the persistent cross-reactivity.
