# For a true zwitterionic single amino acid, we need to:
# 1. Load the N-terminal version of PRO (has NH2+)
# 2. Then apply C-terminal patch (add OXT, change charges)

# Actually, let's try building from sequence with explicit termini
# The trick is to use both NPRO and apply the C-terminal modifier

# Create zwitterionic PRO - use the sequence command with single residue
# AMBER should automatically cap both ends
pro = sequence { PRO }

# Now manually change the C-terminus to be charged (add OXT)
# Using the remove and bond commands

# First, let's see what we have
desc pro.1
charge pro
